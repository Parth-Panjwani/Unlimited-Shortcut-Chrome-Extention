# 🔗 Unlimited Shortcuts - Chrome New Tab Extension

A sleek custom **New Tab page** that lets you add **unlimited shortcuts** — without clutter or limits.

## ✨ Motivation

Google Chrome’s default new tab only allows **up to 10 shortcuts**, which is often too limiting for users who rely on multiple tools, websites, and platforms daily.

Saving links in bookmarks becomes messy and inconvenient, especially for frequent or visual access.

**Unlimited Shortcuts** solves this by giving you a fully editable, aesthetic new tab where you can:

- Add, edit, or delete **as many shortcuts** as you want
- Enjoy a clean, centered interface without noise
- Automatically fetch website favicons for visual clarity
